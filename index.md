# Grading Scheme 

**Pass or Fail**

CHEP 990 is treated as a course, in which students receive a ‘grade’ (e.g., in progress/incomplete/pass) at the end of each term that a student is enrolled. Once a student has completed all requirements of the 990 class a grade of CR (Completed Requirements) will be applied to the final term in which the student was registered. All other terms will retain the grade IP (In Progress).

Information on literal descriptors for grading at the University of Saskatchewan can be found at: [https://students.usask.ca/academics/grading/grading-system.php#GradingSystem](https://students.usask.ca/academics/grading/grading-system.php#GradingSystem)

> **Please note:** There are different literal descriptors for undergraduate and graduate students. More information on the Academic Courses Policy on course delivery, examinations and assessment of student learning can be found at: [http://policies.usask.ca/policies/academic-affairs/academic-courses.php](http://policies.usask.ca/policies/academic-affairs/academic-courses.php)

## Ground Rules

- Be proactive
- Listen Actively
- Speak from experience and relate this to published research
- The goal is to learn – disagreement is ok
- We will encounter some challenging conversations during this course– we ask that you extend compassion and respect towards your peers during the discussions.
- We will all fail to follow the ground rules at some point… that’s ok

## Attendance Expectations 

- The 990 seminars are geared toward skill building sessions for all students. While all CHEP students should participate in these sessions, attendance is mandatory for new students. Students in their second year and upwards must attend the relevant sessions as outlined in the two year cycle.
- All students are required to attend Student Research Day and Faculty and Associate Research Day. A core requirement of the 990 seminar is the student’s presentation of their thesis work at the annual CHEP Student Research Day.
- Students are required to attend, at a minimum, 70% of the seminar sessions. The 70% will be calculated per term.
- Masters students in their 4th year (or beyond) and PhD students in their 5th year (or beyond) are considered to have met the 990 requirement and attendance is no longer mandatory except for Student/Resident Research Day in Term 2.

## Participation in Journal Club

- You are expected to do the readings before seminar

## Readings

- The seminar is readings-based
- You are expected to do the readings before seminar
- If you have not done your readings, you will not be able to contribute
- See ground rules

## What if I miss Seminar?

If you miss a seminar you can make up the session in one of 3 different ways:

1. You can attend a guest lecture, workshop, or conference that happens outside of the regular seminar time. This can be anything related to your thesis or other type of professional development. You can fill in the information (title, location, date, time) on the “additional seminar form” and have the presenter or organizer sign the form.
   - We recommend our department journal club, held weekly (Fridays, 12-1pm) that is jointly offered by CH&E faculty/senior students and the Public Health and Preventive Medicine residency program. Alternatives include seminars offered by the Division of Social Accountability (DSA), Canadian Centre for Health and Safety in Agriculture (CCHS), the School of Public Health, other departments/colleges, or community events or advocacy events.
2. If the seminar involves a reading, you can write a 500-word summary and reflection about the reading. The document should include a 250-word summary of the readings and a 250-word reflection about the readings. These should be emailed to the course instructor.
3. If the seminar does not involve a reading, you can read a journal article of your choice and write a 500 summary and reflection. The document should include a 250-word summary of the readings and a 250-word reflection about the readings. These should be emailed to the course instructor.

With speakers’ permission, 990 sessions/events will be recorded and available to those students experiencing connectivity/time zone issues. You will still be expected to submit a summary and reflection if you watch the recording.

> **Note.** It is expected that students attend the seminar in person as much as possible.
